Version 0.6 (29 december 2005)
------------------------------

MarryampicII is a card game where you must find pairs.
There is 2 playing mode available.
In the "Classic memory rule", you find any pair, and when found, the sound associated
to that pair is played.
In the "Only sound pair rule", first a sound is played, then you must find the pair
that match the sound that's played before (press SPACE to hear back that sound)
The madness option is when you do not keep the same sound after each try ! Really hard...

One to Four players can play in turn.

A preview of the cards during X seconds is possible.


Marryampic I was an Amiga game coded in Blitz Basic.
Marryampic II requires the SDL library, SDL_image and SDL_mixer. It has been recoded from scratch.
The cardsets done for Marryampic I can be used with this version.

Warning ! : no CardSet is included in this archive, if you haven't any
CardSet you must first download one for this game.
After downloading, put the cardset in the cards directory.
You can found a CardSet of animals, on www.aminet.net in game/data/MRP_Animals.lha
and many others on my web page.


In a console, type "make" to recompile the game. Tested here with a Linux Mandrake.
Type "./marryampic2" to start the game.
To have a fullscreen video mode use "-f" or "--fullscreen" as parameter, or press 'f' key during setup.


This game is released under the terms of GNU General Public License.


If you want to make your own cardsets, take a look at the file MakingCardsets.txt in the docs
directory.


Note for IFF ILBM 24 bits pictures :
per default, Marryampic try to load the IFF ILBM 24bits picture if available in the cardset directory.
If your old SDL_image library version can not show correctly theses pictures (bad colors), comment the line in the Makefile.
I've joined my current file IMG_lbm.c that support those files if you want to recompile
your SDL_image version ( in docs/ILBM_24bits/ ).


Have fun !
