MARRYAMPIC II
-------------
Making your own CardSets !


First, your cardset MUST be in a directory.
This drawer as all the cardsets must be in the directory "cards".


In your cardset directory you will find the following files :


   ------------------------------------------------------------
=> a PICTURE containing all your different pairs+the backdrop :
   ------------------------------------------------------------
    CardPic.IFF        for an ECS display mode compatible with all Amiga.
    CardPic_AGA.IFF    for an AGA Amiga (or CGX/P96) display mode.
    CardPic_24bits.iff (used by Marryampic2)
 or/and
    CardPic.jpg        (used by Marryampic2)
 or/and
    CardPic.png        (used by Marryampic2)

   A little explain to understand the mean of each picture file :
   * For Marryampic 1 :
     ==================
   The CardPic.IFF must be an ILBM picture file that all Amiga can use. It must
   always be present (ex: 640x512, 16 colors).
   The CardPic_AGA.IFF is an ILBM picture file that AGA Amigas and owners of
   graphics cards can display (ex: 640x512, 256 colors).
   Files CardPic_24bits.iff & CardPic.jpg are not used with these version.
   * For Marryampic 2 :
     ==================
   This version try to load one picture file in the following order :
   PNG > JPEG > 24 bits IFF > AGA IFF > IFF.
   With only a CardPic.png file, it is enough and will work !
   * For Marryampic 1 & 2 :
     ======================
   To make a cardset compatible with the 2 versions, the files CardPic.IFF
   and CardPic_AGA.IFF must be included !!!
   And join preferably a CardPic.png or CardPic.jpg file for better quality
   graphics if required.

   You draw all your cards in a picture with a size of 640x480 pixels. You must
   reserve at least a middle height of your screen free (You only draw the pairs 1 (one)
   time!)

   You don't have to centre your cards on the screen (in X&Y), Marryampic
   will calculate the spacing for your cards with the info given in the
   file CardInfo.TXT.  All the resolutions could be used, and as many
   colors as you want... (except IFF HAM-6 and HAM-8 mode.)

   The backdrop card must be placed after all the cards on the left.

   <!> You must not have more than 50 cards on a horizontal line. Not
       enough? uuhh!? ;-)

   Note: For IFF picture, the color number 0 and the number 1 MUST be different.
         ( Colour #1 is used to display messages. ) Also note that colors
         2 & 3 are used for the intuition interface, colors 17, 18, & 19 are
         used for the pointer... so don't hesitate to swap & remap the
         picture.


   ----------------------------------------------------
=> all the differents digitized SAMPLES of your pairs :
   ----------------------------------------------------
    CardSample-xx.IFF
  or
    CardSample-xx.wav

   where xx is the number of the pair from 1 to number of different pairs.

   The 2 samples "SampleFound.IFF" and "SampleFinished.IFF"
   (or "SampleFound.wav" and "SampleFinished.wav")
   will be used during the game if they are present.

   Do not pack the IFF samples with XPK if you want to spread cardsets !
   (not supported with Marryampic2 and probably never)

   A little explain to understand the mean of each sound file :
   * For Marryampic 1 :
     ==================
     These version can only play IFF 8SVX samples.
   * For Marryampic 2 :
     ==================
     These version can play IFF 8SVX and WAV samples.


   --------------------------------------------------------------
=> a descriptive file on how are drawned your cards: CardInfo.TXT
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   there are lines for:
   WIDTH=      : width of your cards in number of pixels.
   HEIGHT=     : height of your cards in number of pixels.
   NUMBER_X=   : number of cards on a horizontal line.
   NUMBER_Y=   : number of cards on a vertical line.
   SPACING_X=  : number of pixels between each card on a horizontal line.
   SPACING_Y=  : number of pixels between each card on a vertical line.

   The following lines are only used by Marryampic1.
   FONT=..../y : the font the screen should use if present (otherwise
                 it will use the standart topaz/8). (Optional line)
   MODEID=     : the screen mode to open.
                 Number must be in hexadecimal, and can be defined in the
                 setup window with the "ScreenMode" button. (Optional line)
                 For an upload on Aminet (for example!), please DO NOT PUT
                 THIS LINE, as it can cause trouble to many people not
                 having the same graphic card (and the same MODEID) than
                 you !!! If that line already exists, delete it !!!

You can edit the file CardInfo.TXT, with any ASCII editor.


The better way before to make a cardset is to look in the drawer of an already made CardSet, all the
differents files.
The number of the samples for the cards are coded like this :
example: position of the pairs for a game with 10 pairs.
             1     2     3    4    5
             6     7     8    9    10
             Backdrop



-End-

To verify that your new cardset is ok, press the SPACE BAR in the Setup & you will be able to see each
pair of cards and hear the associated sample for it.

If you make a new cardset, please send it to me.
