Littles notes if you want from digitized pictures, creating the
final picture of your cardset.

Softs used:
  ADpro
  DPaint



# Scanning the pitures or grabbing video screens:

I personnaly use Vidi-24RT, but any scanner or others should be nice.
See the doc of your hardware...



# Cutting your pictures to keep only what you want:

I use ADpro for this.
-Load the picture
-Use CropVisual operator
 set width and height to the size of your final card
 set keep aspect on (your picture will not be distorted)
 Move the frame and size it, to keep what you want
 Click accept
-Save your new image in IFF 24 bits (important)



# Resizing your picture to the size of the final cards

I use again ADpro for this.
-Load the new image cropped.
-Use Scale operator
 set width and height to the size of the final cards
 Click accept
-Save your scaled image in IFF 24 bits



# Assembling all the pictures on the same picture

I use ADpro.
-Load a 24 bits black picture of the size of the screen.
-Set the option of loading to Comp (instead of Replc)
-Load each pictures where you want.
-Set the dither mode to floyd or other.
-Set a number of colours (16 for ECS or 256 for AGA)
-Click execute
-Save your picture 'CardPic.IFF' or 'CardPic_AGA.IFF'



# Rearranging the colours (to allow messages to be displayed)

I use DPaint.
Marryampic use the colour #1 for the text displayed in the bottom.
Colour #0 and #1 should be very different.
-Load the picture
-Open the palette (click with right button of the colour)
-If colour #0 is nearly the same than colour #1 :
 swap colour #1 and another one : very different. (button EX)
-Click OK
-Use the menu Color/Remap
-Save back your picture.
Now the messages can be correctly seen.
